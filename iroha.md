## Soramitsu Use-Cases for HL Iroha

HL Iroha allows you to tokenize almost any information and easily bring blockchain into your business. Here is how we use it:

### Payment solutions: Bakong

Often enough, truly decentralized solutions are not available for payment due to delays in receiving confirmations or due to overcomplexity of the technology.

Hyperledger Iroha provides fast and clear payment options using built-in commands, permissions, roles, multi-signature accounts and batches. Asset management is easy as in centralized systems while providing necessary security guarantees. By simplifying the rules and commands required to create and transfer assets, we lower the barrier to entry, while at the same time maintaining high-security guarantees. Bakong is a payment system that is developed in collaboration with the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) using Hyperledger Iroha blockchain.

### Fund management: D3 Ledger

With the support of multi-signature transactions, it is possible to maintain a fund by many managers. The fund assets should be held at one account. Its signatories should be fund managers, who are dealing with investments and portfolio distributions.

One of the managers can confirm a deal by sending the original transaction and one of the managers' signatures. Iroha will maintain the transaction pending so that the deal will not be completed until it receives the required number of confirmations, which is parametrized with the transaction quorum parameter.

### Identity Management: SORA

Hyperledger Iroha has intrinsic support for identity management. Each user in the system has a uniquely identified account with personal information, and each transaction is signed and associated with a certain user. This makes Hyperledger Iroha perfect for various application with KYC (Know Your Customer) features.

Sora is a decentralized economy that provides its citizens various opportunities to decide which projects and ideas should be supported and which ones should not - that way everyone benefits from making the economy stronger and the world - better.

## Frequently asked question

### Q: What is Hyperledger Iroha?

A: Iroha is a framework on which you can write your own private blockchains (also known as decentralised ledgers). Iroha is not a network but a framework on which you can create your own blockchain networks.

### Q: How is it different from other options for creating blockchains?

A: Hyperledeger Iroha is very simple, fast, written on C++. It has an amazing and reliable byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithm called YAC. You can even deploy an Iroha node on simple ARM devices!

### Q: What are the main perks of Iroha?

A: We are very proud of the following features that really make Iroha special:

**YAC** - a real consensus that will make sure of the safety of the ledger, even if some amount of nodes are faulty or cannot be trusted

**Multisignature** - option for transactions when you need not only one signature to get transaction settled but more than that. If you need your operations to be, for example, signed by several people, this would be a great choice for you!

**Client libraries** - you can write applications on almost any platform - on your mobile phone or tablet or anything else. Moreover, with C++ and neat architecture you can even deploy a real node using just a simple ARM device!

### Q: Why would I use Hyperledger Iroha and not other Hyperledger frameworks?

A: As we see it, Hyperledger technologies are not competitors but different options tailored for specific tasks. Iroha is simple - it is easy to start using it, has some options that are very good for asset transactions and change of simple account data.

### Q: Does Hyperledger Iroha has Smart contracts at the moment?

A: Iroha only has a set of predefined contracts called ""commands"" at the moment. So there are some simple to use instructions that can already be used for a diverse range of operations with user data and assets. We are planning to create custom commands too! Come and join us if you'd like to contribute!

### Q: What projects already use Hyperledger Iroha?

A: Iroha is used in payment systems, D3Ledger project that provides safekeeping of digital assets and some of our community members use it for healthcare related projects - to create tokens and provide transportation of data. You can also find a new way to use Iroha in your project!
